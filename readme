These are some of the scripts I used in my research.
Most of them deal with seqquest, extracting data or generating inputs.
The visualisation output is usually in .xyz format. 
A few of the script also deal with coordinate converstions.
Works only on linux, and also use as it is, no guarantee.
feel free to grab them if you like.

PS: Most of them are crude with no exit status as they were only meant 
local use.
